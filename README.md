- 👀 I’m interested in learning! (Cliche, I know; bear with me)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Django, and dipping my toe into blockchain stuff
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on (see above)
- 📫 How to reach me lwalters224@gmail.com or @theLucasWalters on Twitter (DMs always open!)

Also yes, I did just use the default template the github gave me. I really hate bios 😂
